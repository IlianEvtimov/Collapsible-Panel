### Expandable Panel Component

This component features a panel with a label in the top-left corner and an image in the top-right corner. The image, a PNG file located in the resource file `MyComponentResources.RES`, has an `onClick` event that toggles the panel between expanded and collapsed states. This functionality is useful when you need more space to arrange additional components.

#### Key Features:
- **Label**: Positioned in the top-left corner of the panel.
- **Image**: Positioned in the top-right corner, acting as a toggle button. The image is sourced from the resource file `MyComponentResources.RES`.
- **Expandable/Collapsible Panel**: The panel can be expanded or collapsed by clicking the image, allowing for dynamic space management.

This component is ideal for applications that require flexible layouts with the ability to show or hide additional content as needed.
